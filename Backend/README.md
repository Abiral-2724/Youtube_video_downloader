# `/users/register` Endpoint Documentation

This endpoint is used to register a new user into the system by providing the required details. The API validates the user input, checks if the email already exists in the database, and creates a new user if the input is valid.

---

## **Endpoint**

`POST /users/register`

---

## **Description**

This endpoint allows new users to register by providing their full name, email, and password.  
It performs the following operations:
1. Validates the input fields.
2. Checks if the email already exists in the database.
3. Hashes the user's password for security.
4. Creates a new user in the database.
5. Generates an authentication token for the user.

---

## **Request Body**

The request body should be in JSON format with the following structure:

### **Required Fields**

## **Implementation Notes**

1. **Validation Rules**:
   - Email must be valid and unique.
   - First name must be at least 3 characters.
   - Password must be at least 6 characters.

2. **Password Security**:
   - The password is hashed using `bcrypt` before saving to the database.

3. **Authentication Token**:
   - A JWT token is generated for authenticated sessions.

4. **Database Model**:
   - User information is stored in the `users` collection in MongoDB.

---

## **How to Use**

1. Send a `POST` request to `/users/register` with the required fields in the request body.
2. Handle validation or success responses based on the status code.

For any issues or questions, contact the developer team.

How the Data is Processed
Input Validation:

The email must be a valid email format.
The password must be at least 6 characters long.
User Authentication:

The user's email is used to search for the corresponding user in the database.
The provided password is compared with the hashed password stored in the database using comparePassword method.
JWT Token Generation:

If the email and password match, a JWT token is generated using user.generateAuthToken() and returned in the response.
Implementation Notes
Dependencies:

The express-validator library is used to validate the request fields (email and password).
The password is hashed and stored securely using bcrypt.
JWT is used for authentication to allow users to remain logged in.
Database Interaction:

The userModel.findOne() method is used to find the user by email.
The comparePassword() method is used to compare the entered password with the stored hash.
Token Generation:

The generateAuthToken() method creates a JWT token to authenticate the user for subsequent requests.
How to Use
Send a POST request to /users/login with the required email and password fields in the request body.
Handle validation errors if the input is incorrect.
If the login is successful, the server will return a JWT token and user details.
If the credentials are invalid, an error message will be returned


## **logout And Profile** 
Here is a `README.md` file documentation for the `/users/profile` and `/users/logout` endpoints:

```markdown
# API Documentation

## `/users/profile`
### Method: `GET`
### Description:
This endpoint retrieves the profile of the authenticated user. It requires a valid authentication token passed in the request headers or cookies.

### Request Headers:
- `Authorization`: Bearer token (or the token is passed via `cookies`).

### Response:
- **Status Code**: `200 OK`
- **Body**:
  ```json
  {
    "user": {
      "_id": "userId",
      "firstname": "John",
      "lastname": "Doe",
      "email": "john.doe@example.com",
      "createdAt": "2024-12-07T00:00:00.000Z",
      "updatedAt": "2024-12-07T00:00:00.000Z"
    }
  }
  ```

### Status Codes:
- `200 OK`: Successfully retrieved the user profile.
- `401 Unauthorized`: Invalid or missing token.

### Example Request:
```http
GET /users/profile
Authorization: Bearer <your-token>
```

## `/users/logout`
### Method: `GET`
### Description:
This endpoint logs the user out by clearing the authentication token from cookies and adding it to the blacklist to prevent reuse.

### Request Headers:
- `Authorization`: Bearer token (or the token is passed via `cookies`).

### Response:
- **Status Code**: `200 OK`
- **Body**:
  ```json
  {
    "message": "Logged out successfully"
  }
  ```

### Status Codes:
- `200 OK`: Successfully logged out.
- `401 Unauthorized`: Invalid or missing token.

### Example Request:
```http
GET /users/logout
Authorization: Bearer <your-token>
```

---

## How Data is Required:

### `GET /users/profile`
- **Authorization Token**: A valid JWT token is required to access the user's profile. The token should be passed either in the `Authorization` header (with Bearer) or as a `cookie`.

### `GET /users/logout`
- **Authorization Token**: A valid JWT token is required to log out. The token should be passed either in the `Authorization` header (with Bearer) or as a `cookie`.

---

### Notes:
- For both endpoints, the JWT token is necessary for authentication. If the token is invalid, expired, or not provided, the request will be denied with a `401 Unauthorized` status.
- The `/logout` endpoint ensures the token is blacklisted, preventing future use.
```
